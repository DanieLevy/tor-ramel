You will be provided with a single problematic component from this project.

Tasks for the agent:

Deeply analyze the component to fully understand its functionality, dependencies, inputs/outputs, side effects, and usage in the project.

Identify any structural, maintainability, or performance issues.

If the component is too large or complex, split it into smaller, manageable functions or subcomponents, but avoid over-splitting or creating excessive files. Keep readability and usability in mind.

Redesign the component structure where necessary to improve clarity, robustness, and maintainability, while preserving existing functionality.

Ensure all internal logic is consistent, side effects are controlled, and public interfaces (props, exports, handlers) remain clear.

After changes, run lint to ensure no errors or warnings.

Provide example patches or refactored code with clear structure and comments for readability.

Constraints:

Focus only on the provided component and its dependencies.

Do not generate summaries or ask follow-up questions.

The goal is a fully understood, robust, maintainable component, optionally split into smaller chunks if required, without breaking functionality.
