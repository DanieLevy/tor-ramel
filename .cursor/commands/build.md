Perform a complete build audit and fix of this project.

Steps for the agent:

Run the full build process locally (e.g., npm run build, next build, or equivalent).

Detect all build errors, warnings, or misconfigurations.

For each issue:

Identify the root cause, not just the surface symptom.

Suggest and apply a robust fix that preserves all existing functionality.

Ensure changes do not break other components, routes, or dependencies.

Analyze related configurations (next.config.js, tailwind.config.js, shadcn/ui, Dockerfile, .env, etc.) to ensure fixes are consistent with project setup.

Re-run the build after each fix to verify the issue is fully resolved.

Deliverables:

A per-issue table (file/module | build error/warning | root cause | fix applied | verification).

Suggested patches or changes (unified diffs) applied to the project.

Notes on potential side-effects of each fix and why it preserves other functionality.

Constraints:

The analysis and fixes run on the local project folder in development mode.

Do not generate overall summaries or ask follow-up questions.

Do not perform security scans.

The goal is only to produce a fully building project with all root causes addressed properly.
