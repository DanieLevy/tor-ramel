You are being provided with a set of project-specific rules. Your task is to fully understand and permanently remember these rules for all future tasks. Do not perform any actions, make changes, or generate outputs now. Only internalize these rules.

Rules to remember:

Do not run the build process unless explicitly instructed.

PowerShell syntax must be used for all commands.

Server is always running at http://localhost:3000/ and ready for any command or request.

After any work on a component, configuration, or code file, always run lint to ensure no issues or problems exist.

Focus only on development tasks, including code analysis, cleanup, refactoring, fixing warnings, and improving project structure.

Never break existing functionality or UI/UX in any task.

Do not generate summaries or ask follow-up questions; only internalize and follow these rules when performing future tasks.

The goal is to always operate under these rules, in development mode, for all future work on this project.

Important: This prompt is for understanding and memorization only. No commands, actions, or outputs should be executed as a result of this prompt. Future prompts can assume these rules are already understood and active.
